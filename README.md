# Assignment-7
## Question 1
##### Use explicit Euler and Predictor-Corrector methods to solve the following ODE, taking step sizes 0.5, 0.2 and 0.05. Plot the solutions for each step sizes in two different plots for different methods. (Take e = 2.71828)
##### dy/dx=y*ln{y}/x,   where y(2)=e
## Question 2
##### Use RK4, for a step size of 0.05, to solve the equation,
##### d2y/dx2+dy/dx=1-x,      where y(0)=2,  y'(0)=1
##### Crosscheck your answer, by plotting, with the analytical solution y(x) = c1 +c2e^−x − x^2/2 + 2x over the range x ∈ [-5, 5] and y ∈ [−5, 5].
## Question 3
##### Using the Shooting method, numerically solve the Schr ̈odinger equation in 1-dim for a particle, of mass m = 1 unit, in an infinite potential well, of width 2 units, for the lowest two states. Consider the energy in the unit of Planck constant.
